My name is Robin Verbeek and I am a PhD candidate at the Erasmus School of Economics at the Applied Economics department. My research is on mental health with a focus on the effects of digital media on youth mental health outcomes. 

My supervisors are [Owen O'Donnell](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/people/owen-odonnell) and [Olivier Marie](https://sites.google.com/site/oliviermarie/).
